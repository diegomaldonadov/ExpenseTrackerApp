# ExpenseTrackerApp
Portofolio

Followed the React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) course to build this expense tracker app using React framework,
really enjoy learning and applying logic to this project, that basically you can keep your expenses and filter those expenses through the years, most 
of the functions are base on the useState hook from React in which we handle the arrays objects using title, description, amount and date state, applied
array functions to access the object property values, such as filter and map functions and ternary conditions to make visible the new expense form. There are many more features I can add to this project, but will
continue making projects and share with this community. 

You can see the app in this live demo. Thanks!
